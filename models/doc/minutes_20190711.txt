July 11, 2019 - Talked to Frank:

What to do next:
    - Document what you've got so far
    - Change the algorithm's way to calculate recalled:
        - Nothing gets recalled in the first period (the first N weeks, where N = policy)
        - Everything after the first period, is counted as recalled
    - Calculate the 'median' recalled per day (Bytes)
    - Separate initial dataset in 4 categories:
        1. NANOAOD
        2. MINIAOD & MINIAODSIM
        3. AOD
        4. Everything else not in (1,2 & 3)
    - (*)Keep a distribution of recalled per day (Bytes)
        - Please send Frank the distribution per week, we'll see later if needed per day
    - Plot per week: (all Bytes)
        - working_set
        - recalled
        - freed
