What is  a newly accessed dataset?
    - a datset that is accessed for first time? OR
    - a dataset that is accessed for first time and near to its creation date?
        - what is near?
        - possitive and negative near?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-> Datasets that are older than the date when we start looking at the data get dropped
-> Frank asked to build two histograms for MINI only for the first 50 and 100 days with
    the bins fixed to 50 and 100 respectively (1 bin per day)

-> Based on that and the original deltaT histograms We decided to set deltaT
    to 7 and 14 weeks
