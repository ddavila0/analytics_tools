- Reconsider delta + policy

- A dataset cannot be at the same time in both the working set of accessed and
    the working set of created, right?

- We should consider looking few weeks forward to do not count an early access
    to a newly created dataset as recalled when the access appears before the
    creation of the dataset
    How much is few?
